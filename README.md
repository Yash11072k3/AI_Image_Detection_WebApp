# 🚀 AI-Generated Image Detection Web App  
Detect whether an image is real or AI-generated using deep learning and hybrid ensemble models.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview  
This project combines multiple deep learning models — **CNN**, **ResNet**, **DIF**, **UFD**, and **PatchSelection** — to detect AI-generated images.  
The final prediction is made using a **weighted hybrid voting system**, providing high accuracy across various datasets.
